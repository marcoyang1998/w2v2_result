 GENERAL OBSERBATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESERTE DISHES (-3538-142836-0000)
 THE EXPENCE OF PRESERBING THEM WITH SHOGER IS A SEERIOUS OUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SHOGER IS USED IN CONSCIDERABLE QUALITIES THES SUCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN (-3538-142836-0001)
 FRUIT GATHERED IN WETT OR FOULLY WETHER WILL SOON BE MILDEURED AND BE OF NO SERVISS FOR PRESERVES (-3538-142836-0002)
WBUT TO DESTINGWUISH THESE PROPERLY EQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONCIDERABLE EXPERIENCE (-3538-142836-0003)
HIF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SERP AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TUNASITY OF THE SERP WILL ON SEPERATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BRAKES THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD (-3538-142836-0004)
 LET IT BOIYLL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUMB THAT HAS RISEN (-3538-142836-0005)
 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SAUFITIANTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOOUN PORES OUT LIKE OILE (-3538-142836-0006)
 BEFORE SHOGER WAS INUCE HUNNEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRISERVE MANY VEDGITIBLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE AS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUCE OF THE SHOGER CAME (-3538-142836-0007)
FORETEEN NINEDY NINE (-3538-142836-0008)
 BULL THEM UP THREE DAY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR YUSE (-3538-142836-0009)
 THE REASON WHIYE THE FRUIT IS EMTYED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN ERTHAN PAN IS THAT THE ASCETD OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE (-3538-142836-0010)
 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROSSESS OF PRESERVING FRUTS BY SOURP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED (-3538-142836-0011)
 THEY SHOULD BE DRIVED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON THE SEAVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EAIGTE HOUERS FRESH POUDERD SHOGER BEING SIPPTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIRETURND (-3538-142836-0012)
 AIN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORENGEAN LEMMANSHIPS ARE PRESERVED (-3538-142836-0013)
KMARMALADES JAMS AND FRUITPASTS R OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENEARALAL QUESTE (-3538-142836-0014)

THAT THEY MAY KEEPE IT IS NECESSARLY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SHOGER FIFTEEN O THREE (-3538-142836-0016)
 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FORE PRESERVED MAKING WHN THE PRESERBING PAN IS YUSED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBET UNLESS THE GAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NESCSARY (-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EITE (-3538-142836-0018)
 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VERIOUS PREPERATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VERIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS ERABS ROUCS ENGUCES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SHOGER WERE FORMALLY EMPLOYED IN FARMASCY AS WELL AS FOR SWEATMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATAINWARD CONPEIRSAY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TURM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEATE PUID MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMTED IN THE ORDINARY COASENE (-3538-142836-0019)
THEA THOUSAND AND ORN ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORND THE TABLES OF THE WELTHY SHULD BE PERCHAUCED FROM THE CONVECTIONER THEY CAN NOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME (-3538-142836-0020)
 HOWEVER AS LAIDE AS THE RAIN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULAUS SUMBS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FENSIFUL DESERTS (-3538-142836-0021)

 THE SPATELE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPER CEAPT BRIGHTE AND CLEAN (-3538-142836-0025)
 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROSSESS OF DIJESTION IS APT TO PRVOK INDISPOSITION (-3538-142836-0026)
 THERE WAS ONCE ELT A TIME A WIDOWERE WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE (-3538-163619-0000)
IFROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE KNEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MANS CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRIYE TO ERN HIS OWN BREAD (-3538-163619-0001)

WHE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN (-3538-163622-0004)
 THE MIKING PROMISCED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWAORD THUT HE HAD PROLISHED HIS BROTHER (-3538-163622-0005)
EWHEN HE HAD RUNE AFTER THE FOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEIF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE DUSTOFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM (-3538-163622-0006)
 COMANDER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SOUN AND LET ME COME YOUR HAIR (-3538-163622-0007)

 THEY SEEMED AS THOUGF SOME PEACE OF GOOD FORTUN HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE (-4350-10919-0032)

 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIGHFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER (-4350-9170-0000)
HISS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORECTD (-4350-9170-0001)
 IN THE SOCAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AME OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILLE VOLANTARILLY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTREST FOR THE ENTERST OF THE GROUP (-4350-9170-0002)
 THE CHAMPIANS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRIE TO CONNECT THE IDEAOF ATHORITY THAT IS OF VILENCE WITHTHE IDEA OF MORAL INFLOANCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE (-4350-9170-0003)
 THE MAN WH IS CONTROLD BY MORAL INFLOUENCE ACTS IN ACQUORDEANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES (-4350-9170-0004)
THE BACES OF ATHOURITY IS BODLY VILENCE (-4350-9170-0005)
 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODLY VILENCE TOE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANISATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNICEN AND SOUMITION TO ONE WILL (-4350-9170-0006)
 THESE BANS OF ARMED MEN SUB MITTIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMEY (-4350-9170-0007)
 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BACSES OF POWER (-4350-9170-0008)
 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN SCEASERS TO THE RUSHION AND GERMAN EMPEORS TAKE MORE INTREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING IN CORT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF FAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE (-4350-9170-0009)
NDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE (-4350-9170-0010)
HONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COUD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED (-4350-9170-0011)
 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRY MEN AN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BACED ON POWER HAS NO GUSTIFICATION (-4350-9170-0012)
YEVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LO STANDERDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VILENCE THE EXISTANCE OF AN OTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VILENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECASE THE VILENC OF THE GOVERMENT WAS LESSN THE VILENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THA THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING (-4350-9170-0013)
 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE<unk>S STATE A SUBJECT TO A SINGL OTHORITY THE STRIKE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEM STILL LESS AND HA LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SOUCURE (-4350-9170-0014)
 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST (-4350-9170-0015)
HAFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPARE PUTS AN END TO INTURNAL DECENDIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFYES ITSELF (-4350-9170-0016)
 BUT THIS CUASSIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY (-4350-9170-0017)
 INTERNAL DESCENTIONS DISAPPEARE ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE OTHORITY OVER THE DESCINTIAN INDIVIDUALS (-4350-9170-0018)
 GOVERN ATHORITY EVEN IF IT DUS SUPPRESS PRIVATE VILENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VILENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DIRATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT (-4350-9170-0019)
 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE UPPREST ALWAYS GOWS HON GROWING UP TO THE FERTHERST LAMENT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOUSE WITH THE GOLDENEXTS (-4350-9170-0020)
 THE MOST CONVINSING EXAMPLE OF US IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOK WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAIVES OF ANCIANT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST (-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN  (-4350-9170-0022)
 FOOTNOT THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF ATTHORITY EXIST INSPIGHE OF A SMALL MUMBER OF THEIR TROUPS NOT ONLY FAILE TO DISPPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT (-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPERCLASSERS NOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE IN SUFITINT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINCORTENS MAN THEY FEAL THAT THE CURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCRESTRENGTH OF THE ARMEY (-4350-9170-0024)
 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESENTALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPS ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOCH GARDS AND MAKE THE RUSHIAON OTHORTIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE REGRUTS SO THAT THE REGIMENS FROM THE FRONTEARE THIRE STATIONED IN SENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE SENTERE ARE STATIONED ON HE FRONTEARS (-4350-9170-0025)
 THE MEAENING OF CUPRIVIOUS SPEACH PUT INTO PLAYEN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNS AR NEAEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREN FOS BUT TO BUYE UNDER OFFISERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE I SLAVE TOILING MASSES (-4350-9170-0026)
 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY (-4350-9170-0027)

SANDSO EVERY GOVERMENT NEADS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BUTY FROM ITS NIGHBOR BRIGANS (-4350-9170-0029)
 THIS INCRIASE IS CONTAGOUS AS MONTASKEW POINTED OUT A HUNDREAND FIFTY YEARS AGO (-4350-9170-0030)
 EVERY INCRIEASE AND THE ARMY OF ONES STATE WITH THE AME OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATS AND CALLES FOR A SIMOLAR INCRIACE IN THEIR ARMIES (-4350-9170-0031)
 THE DESPATISAME OF THE GOVERMENT ALWAYS INCRIEASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF HE ARMY AND ITS EXTURNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGRESSIVE NESS OF TH GOVERMENT INCRIEASES WITH ITS INTURNAL DESPITISM (-4350-9170-0032)
 THE RIVALRY OF THE URIPIAN STATS IN CONSTANTLY INCRIASING THEIR FORSES HAS REDUSCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSED TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVAC SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDGERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENCE (-4350-9170-0033)
 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL SITISONS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE ENIQUATIES PRACTICED UPON THE ALL SITISENS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN EMPRESSERS (-4350-9170-0034)
 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MELETHEROY SERVIS (-4350-9170-0035)
 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFIGANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONCSISTS IN MAN<unk>S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBEARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIANESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AME OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS (-4350-9170-0036)
 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVASE IT COMES TO PASSE THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRULTY OF STRICFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTANCE ARE CALLD UPON TO FACE ALL THE PARLES THEY HAD MENT TO AVOIDE (-4350-9170-0037)
 BUT IN STAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NESCESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSITUTING STRIVE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIVE WITH NEIGHBORS (-4350-9170-0038)
 THE TACXCES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPORATIONS OBSORBED THE GREATE ERE PART OF THE PROTUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY AUGHT TO DEFEND (-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER RADY TO BRAKE OUT RENDERES ALL REFORMS OF LIFES SOCIALIHE VAN AND FRUITLESS (-4350-9170-0040)
 BUT THE FAITAL SUGNIFICANS OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVAS AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRODICTION EINHARRENT IND THE SOCIAL CONSEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT (-4350-9170-0041)
 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTURNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE (-4350-9170-0042)
 THEREI NEITHER PRINCIPALTY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES N ACCOMPLICE AND ALL THAT ACTS OF VILENCE OF THE GOVERMENT AGAINST THE SITICENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN (-4350-9170-0043)
ND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKEING THEM (-4350-9170-0044)

HEXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVLE DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY (-4350-9170-0046)
 WE NOW KNOW THAT THRETS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DEMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF INVARMENT AND MORAL INFLOUENCE (-4350-9170-0047)
 SO THAT THES JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VILENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVAL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FORE SENTURIS AGO HAS NONE WHAT EVER NOW (-4350-9170-0048)
HEXCEPT FRE THE STATE THEY TELL US WE HOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EJUCATION CALTURE MEANS OF COMUNICATION IN SOON (-4350-9170-0049)

 THIS ARGUMENTU WAS WELL FOUND IT ONLY SOME SENTIRIES AGO (-4350-9170-0051)
 THE GREAT EXTENDTION OF MEANS OF COMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE ADE IN FORMING SISCITIYES ASSOSIATIONS CORPERATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SIENTIPIC ECAONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS (-4350-9170-0052)
