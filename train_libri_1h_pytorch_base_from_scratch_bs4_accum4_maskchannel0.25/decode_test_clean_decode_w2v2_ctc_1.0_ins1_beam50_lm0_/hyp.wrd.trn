 HABET IS A CONSEPT ENVALVING THE ACCURAENCE OF SIMOLAR EVENTS AT DIFFERAENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIURIST FIELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A FHENOMENAON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMARY WHEN IT ASURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES (-8230-279154-0007)
NBUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN IMFEARANCE IS WARNTED (-8230-279154-0008)
 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONPFIDENCE IN THE ACURISCY OF A MEMARY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDIMENTAL CACES BE BACED UPON A CARACTURISTIC OF THE IMAGE IT SELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPAR IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE (-8230-279154-0009)
 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAG WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE IMFLOUENCE OF PHATEG WE MAY SEE A FRIENDS FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORIBLY DIESTORTED (-8230-279154-0010)

 FAMILIARITY IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGRIEESE (-8230-279154-0012)
WIN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UN FAMILIAR PARTS (-8230-279154-0013)
 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMARY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR NOWLLEGE OF THE PAST (-8230-279154-0014)
 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERING TO MORE ORLESS REMOT PORTIONS OF THE PAST (-8230-279154-0015)
 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VERIOUS FACTURES THAT CONCUR AND GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTNESS AND SOME REMEMBERED EVENT (-8230-279154-0016)
 THERE MAY BE A SPESSCIPHIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLD THE FILLING OF PASTNESS ESPESCHIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONSERNED (-8230-279154-0017)
 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND NOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS (-8230-279154-0018)
HIT WOULD SEM THAT ONLY RATHER REACENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACURATELY BY MEANS OF FIELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FIELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESCENTRAL PART IN THE PROSCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS (-8230-279154-0019)
AIF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN NOWLLEGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMEARY WOULD HAVEBEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE (-8230-279154-0020)

 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN AN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAY (-8230-279154-0023)
 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGU BUT INDUMITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS NOWLEGE OF THE PAST (-8230-279154-0024)
 WE MIGHT PROVIJIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMARY AS THAT WAY OF NOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANNALOG IND OUR NOWLEGE OF THE FEUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEUM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONSERNED THOUGHE SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMARY AS REGARDS IMEDIATSY (-8230-279154-0025)
 THIS DESTINTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMERY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARY OUT IN PRACTIS AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEARY (-8230-279154-0026)

 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST ACCURENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFIR TO PAST ACCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTS NOWLEGE MEMAORY (-8230-279154-0031)
 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEARY OF NOWLLEGE (-8230-279154-0032)
 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELY ABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELLKNOWN ELUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME (-8230-279154-0033)
 WHEN EVER THE SENCE OF FAMILIARITY ACCEURS WITHOUT A DEFINAT OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIEAT OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIER (-8230-279154-0034)
 THUS NO NOWLLEGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE (-8230-279154-0035)
TA FIRTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION (-8230-279154-0036)
WRECOGNITION IN THIS SENCE DUS NOT NESCESSARILLY ENVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOSIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOSIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDETORY IMAGE OF PERRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTEURISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIYZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT (-8230-279154-0037)
 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIYZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENCE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALES THAT NEVER THELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENCE OF THE WORD (-8230-279154-0038)
 THIS NOWLEGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENCE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT (-8230-279154-0039)
 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS IN ATIQUETE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE (-8230-279154-0040)
 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICALT BRAUDLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAON LINKS OF WHICH THE VERIOUS FORMS OF MEMEORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT (-8230-279154-0041)
 THUS IF I RECOGNISE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTANCE AND VERTU OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD (-8230-279154-0042)
 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INATIQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UN AVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMATIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELAMENTORY ACCURENCE AS RECOGNITION (-8230-279154-0043)
