IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE (-1255-138279-0000)
STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF (-1255-138279-0001)
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH (-1255-138279-0002)
AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE (-1255-138279-0003)
NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER (-1255-138279-0004)
THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN (-1255-138279-0005)
THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP (-1255-138279-0006)
AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE (-1255-138279-0007)
TWO THREE (-1255-138279-0008)
FOUR FIVE (-1255-138279-0009)
BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS (-1255-138279-0010)
HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER (-1255-138279-0011)
THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW (-1255-138279-0012)
THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL (-1255-138279-0013)
THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER (-1255-138279-0014)
THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW (-1255-138279-0015)
SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY (-1255-138279-0016)
I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME (-1255-138279-0017)

GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT (-1255-138279-0024)
THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES (-1255-74899-0000)
BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH (-1255-74899-0001)
THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA (-1255-74899-0002)
I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST (-1255-74899-0003)
BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY (-1255-74899-0004)
IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED (-1255-74899-0005)
PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM (-1255-74899-0006)
IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN (-1255-74899-0007)
OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY (-1255-74899-0008)
THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID (-1255-74899-0009)
BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER (-1255-74899-0010)
AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH (-1255-74899-0011)
WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER (-1255-74899-0012)
IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND (-1255-74899-0013)
WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER (-1255-74899-0014)
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED (-1255-74899-0015)
WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND (-1255-74899-0016)
IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID (-1255-74899-0017)
AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME (-1255-74899-0018)
MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING (-1255-74899-0019)
I<unk>D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART (-1255-74899-0020)

AND NOW I<unk>LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD (-1255-74899-0022)
HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME (-1255-90407-0000)
BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER (-1255-90407-0001)
WHY NOT HE INQUIRED (-1255-90407-0002)
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU (-1255-90407-0003)
OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST (-1255-90407-0004)
I SHOULD THINK SO (-1255-90407-0005)
HE<unk>S MY FATHER INDEED (-1255-90407-0006)
BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON (-1255-90407-0007)
MY FATHER<unk>S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY (-1255-90407-0008)
BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE (-1255-90407-0009)
YOU HAVE HEARD SO (-1255-90407-0010)
I DON<unk>T KNOW HE DOESN<unk>T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS (-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE (-1255-90407-0012)
WAS THAT THIS EVENING (-1255-90407-0013)
AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT (-1255-90407-0014)
JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS (-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT (-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON<unk>T CARE TO STAY (-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL (-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW (-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION (-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION (-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE (-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD (-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT (-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME (-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN<unk>S RAIMENT (-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON (-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK (-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE (-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO (-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES (-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON<unk>S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS (-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM<unk>S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER<unk>S COMPANY (-1255-90413-0002)
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL (-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS HE ABLE (-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED (-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION (-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST (-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME (-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS (-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED (-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON<unk>S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS (-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR (-1255-90413-0012)
DON<unk>T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER (-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE (-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL (-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD (-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE<unk>S THE OTHER NIGHT (-1255-90413-0017)
JOCELYN PIERSTON (-1255-90413-0018)
O DIDN<unk>T HE MARRY HER (-1255-90413-0019)

BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW<unk>S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES (-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON (-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL (-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING (-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE (-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED (-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN<unk>S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF (-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER<unk>S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL (-1255-90413-0028)
HE WAS GONE (-1686-142278-0000)
NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS (-1686-142278-0001)
SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN (-1686-142278-0002)
HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR (-1686-142278-0003)
HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER (-1686-142278-0004)
MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF (-1686-142278-0005)
SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER (-1686-142278-0006)
MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER<unk>S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN (-1686-142278-0007)

MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR (-1686-142278-0011)
BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER (-1686-142278-0012)
MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO (-1686-142278-0013)
MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF (-1686-142278-0014)
BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME (-1686-142278-0015)
BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND (-1686-142278-0016)

MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN (-1686-142278-0028)
THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING (-1686-142278-0029)
HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED (-1686-142278-0030)

IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD<unk>S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY (-1686-142278-0033)
AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET<unk>S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING (-1686-142278-0034)
I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE (-1686-142278-0035)

MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE (-1686-142278-0040)

THE BLESSING OF GOD BE UPON THEE MY CHILD (-1686-142278-0095)
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THIS ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK (-1686-142278-0096)
SHE HEARD HIM MURMUR TO HIMSELF THE MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS HAD EVEN MORE PAIN TO BEAR I WILL NOT SHRINK (-1686-142278-0097)
THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MISSUS HALE INQUIRING FOR HER DAUGHTER (-1686-142278-0098)
NOW THIS IS HOW ARTHUR HUNTED THE STAG (-3660-172182-0000)
AND THE LAST DOG THAT WAS LET LOOSE WAS THE FAVORITE DOG OF ARTHUR CAVALL WAS HIS NAME (-3660-172182-0001)
GERAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR<unk>S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS (-3660-172183-0000)
BEFORE GERAINT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT (-3660-172183-0001)
THESE TIDINGS CAME TO ERBIN (-3660-172183-0002)
NOT I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS (-3660-172183-0003)
AND THE TEARS SHE SHED AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM (-3660-172183-0004)
AND EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY (-3660-172183-0005)
THEN GERAINT WENT TO SEE ERBIN (-3660-172183-0006)
SIR SAID HE I AM GOING UPON A QUEST AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I MAY COME BACK (-3660-172183-0007)
TAKE HEED THEREFORE UNTO THY POSSESSIONS UNTIL MY RETURN (-3660-172183-0008)
BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WILL GO WITH ME (-3660-172183-0009)
AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM (-3660-172183-0010)
AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER (-3660-172183-0011)
AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD (-3660-172183-0012)
AND HE RECEIVED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY (-3660-172183-0013)
AND SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FIRST UNTO THEE (-3660-172183-0014)
I WILL DO AS FAR AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE (-3660-172183-0015)
AH MAIDEN SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING FORWARD (-3660-172183-0016)
I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THROUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO THOU THEREFORE WATCH THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT (-3660-172183-0017)
AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED AROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE (-3660-172183-0018)
AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWERS MOWING THE MEADOWS (-3660-172183-0019)
MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO (-3660-172183-0020)
WILT THOU FOLLOW MY COUNSEL SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL FROM ME (-3660-172183-0021)
WHAT SORT OF MEAL HE INQUIRED (-3660-172183-0022)
THEN THEY WASHED AND TOOK THEIR REPAST (-3660-172183-0023)
I GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING (-3660-172183-0024)
I WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST (-3660-172183-0025)
AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK GERAINT WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO (-3660-172183-0026)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY (-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG (-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE (-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION<unk>S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY<unk>S MEN AND WOMEN (-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR (-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT (-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN (-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION (-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT (-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION (-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS (-6123-59150-0010)
HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK (-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE (-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST<unk>S SAKE (-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY (-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS (-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME (-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION (-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO (-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES (-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY (-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS (-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY (-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN<unk>T KILLED HIM I<unk>LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM (-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR (-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY (-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE (-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN (-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY<unk>S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS (-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION (-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY<unk>S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF (-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS (-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW (-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN (-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE (-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY<unk>S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR (-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS (-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER<unk>S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF (-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION (-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT (-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT (-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN (-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE (-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS (-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS (-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY<unk>S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS (-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS (-6123-59150-0046)
HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER (-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM (-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET (-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES (-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO (-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE (-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES (-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT (-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE (-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE (-6123-59186-0009)
IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY (-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LESS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME (-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE (-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS (-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW (-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING<unk>S TRAGEDIES (-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY (-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT (-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY<unk>S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE<unk>S MEMORIES (-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTREST BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY (-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE (-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDY<unk>S POEMS THE OXEN (-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STRAWY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN (-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY<unk>S PREVAILING MOOD (-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY (-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO (-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS (-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE (-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES (-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES (-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS (-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR (-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE (-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDY<unk>S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE (-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH (-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY (-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH (-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE (-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTURES (-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN (-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS (-6123-59186-0040)
BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH (-6841-88291-0000)
I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS (-6841-88291-0001)
SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK<unk>S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN (-6841-88291-0002)
THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN (-6841-88291-0003)
THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS (-6841-88291-0004)
WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT (-6841-88291-0005)
BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE (-6841-88291-0006)
WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED (-6841-88291-0007)
ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND (-6841-88291-0008)
ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER (-6841-88291-0009)
THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS (-6841-88291-0010)
HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE (-6841-88291-0011)
AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH (-6841-88291-0012)
HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE (-6841-88291-0013)
NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF (-6841-88291-0014)
BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED (-6841-88291-0015)
THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM (-6841-88291-0016)
IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE (-6841-88291-0017)
THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE (-6841-88291-0018)
WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH (-6841-88291-0019)
HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS (-6841-88291-0020)
MARKER YELLED THE OTHER (-6841-88291-0021)
THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK (-6841-88291-0022)
PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED (-6841-88291-0023)
THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK (-6841-88291-0024)
THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER (-6841-88291-0025)
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING (-6841-88291-0026)
UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE (-6841-88291-0027)
INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA (-6841-88291-0028)
IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP (-6841-88291-0029)
A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT (-6841-88291-0030)
BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED (-6841-88291-0031)
ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK (-6841-88291-0032)
MISTER FROST<unk>S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES (-6841-88291-0033)
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER (-6841-88291-0034)
AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD (-6841-88291-0035)
HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT (-6841-88291-0036)
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT (-6841-88291-0037)
THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS (-6841-88291-0038)
BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING (-6841-88291-0039)
WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL (-6841-88291-0040)
MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT (-6841-88291-0041)
SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE (-6841-88291-0042)
DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED (-6841-88291-0043)
NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED (-6841-88291-0044)
THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE (-6841-88291-0045)
IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE<unk>S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE (-6841-88291-0046)
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON (-6841-88291-0047)
TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED (-6841-88291-0048)
FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED (-6841-88291-0049)
THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK (-6841-88291-0050)
ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED (-6841-88291-0051)
THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED (-6841-88291-0052)
THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE (-6841-88291-0053)
FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET (-6841-88291-0054)
THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER<unk>S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED (-6841-88291-0055)
I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY<unk>S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN<unk>S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY (-6841-88291-0056)
AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES (-6841-88294-0000)
WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL (-6841-88294-0001)
AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG (-6841-88294-0002)
THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND (-6841-88294-0003)
IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK (-6841-88294-0004)
THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN<unk>T SOUND GOOD (-6841-88294-0005)
WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE<unk>S MOSTLY ALL GONE (-6841-88294-0006)
